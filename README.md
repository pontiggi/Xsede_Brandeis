# Xsede_Brandeis
Template submission scripts and short examples for testing some of the Xsede sites

In these folders you can find a couple of example that you can use to submit calculations on the following Xsede Sites:

Gordon at SDSC

Blacklight at PSC 

Stampede at TACC


NOTE: in all the scripts I have omitted the account number that needs to be charged ,  for obvious reasons :)  it would not be wise to put that on github.  Remember to add that option to the scripts or in the command line using the account for your personal allocation, or my Campus Champion allocation if you are still in the training phase.
